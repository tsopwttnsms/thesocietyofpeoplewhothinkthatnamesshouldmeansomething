    <h1>Welcome to The Society of People who Think that Names Should Mean Something</h1>
    <p>What is our goal? <br>Simple: bring together those with the view that names
        should describe the thing that they are naming. Below you will find many examples
        of organizations that have failed at this task. 
    </p>

    <h3>How do I join?</h3>
    <p>There are a few primary meeting places for the society. First of all, there is the 
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TSOPWTTNSMS/hot/">subreddit</a>. In addition, if
    you have any suggestions for this website, you can reach out at tsopwttnsms@gmail.com.
    In addition, you can join the discord <a href="https://discord.gg/mNk9STck">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Prime Examples of Name Tom-Foolery</h1>
    <h2>The 'hIstOry' Channel</h2>
    <p>As explained by the excellent CGP Grey, and the genesis of this website: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utDHcbiOfKY">link</a></p>
    <h2>The Learning Channel</h2>
    <p>There is no learning going on on this channel.</p>
    <h2>The Eggplant</h2>
    <p>Neither an egg nor a plant.</p>
    <h2>Music Television</h2>
    <p><i>sigh</i></p>
    <br>

    <p>I'll be honest: this is a pretty short list. If you have suggestions for what to add to this list put them in the discord, 
        reddit, or email them at tsopwttnsms@gmail.com</p>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
